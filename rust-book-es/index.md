# The Rust Programming Language

“The Rust Programming Language,” is an introductory book about Rust, with
multiple editions.

The source for all editions lives [on GitHub](https://github.com/rust-lang/book).
Please open issues with any questions, concerns, or tweaks.

If you're not sure what edition you want to read, Go with the [second
edition](second-edition/index.html), as it's the most polished.

## Second Edition

The second edition is still receiving some minor edits, but is effectively
complete. It will be [available in dead-tree form through NoStarch
Press](https://nostarch.com/Rust) once these final edits are complete.

The second edition is a complete re-write of TRPL, from the ground up,
and is therefore very different from the first edition. It's also based
on Rust 1.21, and so may be missing features that landed in stable after
that release.

You can find the second edition [here](second-edition/index.html).

### First Edition

The first edition is completely frozen, but is still included in the
documentation for historical reasons.
